# Machine-learning-with-R-Language
This project offers a comprehensive analysis of the Iris dataset, a well-known benchmark in the field of data science and machine learning. Leveraging RStudio's datasets package, the analysis begins by accessing and exploring the dataset's structure and contents. Using the dplyr package, various data manipulation tasks such as filtering, summarizing, and arranging are performed to gain deeper insights into the dataset's characteristics. Subsequently, the ggplot2 library is employed for data visualization, generating insightful plots like scatter plots and histograms to visualize relationships between variables and the distribution of data. Each step of the analysis is meticulously documented with commented code, ensuring clarity and understanding for users
